# Contains timestamped evaluation results from pipeline runs

This folder stores evaluation results with filenames like:

- evaluation_results_20251124_143210.txt

Each file contains:
- All 20 questions and answers
- Classification accuracy

Previous results are never deleted - each run creates a new timestamped file.
