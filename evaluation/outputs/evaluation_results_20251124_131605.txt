Q11: How does the reduction in MGU-K energy recovery affect the overall power unit efficiency compared to the previous generation?
Category: Complex Reasoning
Classification: ✗ (Expected: reasoning, Got: comparison)
Strategy: ComparisonStrategy

Answer:
To answer the question about how the reduction in MGU-K energy recovery affects the overall power unit efficiency compared to the previous generation, I'll follow the instructions step by step.

**1. Identify the items being compared**

* The new Power Unit (P.U.) with reduced MGU-K energy recovery
* The previous generation of P.U.s

**2. Extract relevant information for EACH item from the context**

New Power Unit:

* Reduced MGU-K energy recovery limit: 5MJ per lap (Article C5.2.10)
* Energy harvested by ERS-K limited to 8.5MJ in each lap (Article C5.2.10, point i)

Previous Generation P.U.s:

* No specific information on energy recovery limits is provided

**3. Present the comparison in a clear, structured format**

| **Item** | **New Power Unit (2026)** | **Previous Generation (No specific data)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy Recovery Limit per Lap | 5MJ (C5.2.10, point i) | Not specified |
| Maximum Harvestable Energy per Lap | 8.5MJ (C5.2.10, point ii) | Not specified |
| Power Unit Efficiency Comparison | N/A | Not possible to compare without data |

**4. Highlight similarities and differences**

* Similarity: Both the new P.U. and previous generation have energy recovery limits in place to prevent excessive energy harvesting.
* Difference: The new P.U.'s reduced MGU-K energy recovery limit and maximum harvestable energy per lap are not directly comparable to the previous generation, as no specific data is provided for the latter.

**5. Cite specific sections**

See references at the end of this response.

**6. If information is missing for any item, explicitly state what's missing**

Data on the previous generation P.U.s' energy recovery limits and power unit efficiency are not available in the provided context.

**7. Do NOT make assumptions or use external knowledge**

The comparison cannot be made without more information on the previous generation P.U.s' specifications.

Q13: If a team exceeds the budget cap due to a force majeure event, what is the likely outcome based on the regulations?
Category: Complex Reasoning
Classification: ✗ (Expected: reasoning, Got: fact)
Strategy: ComplexFactStrategy

Answer:
Based on the provided context, if a team exceeds the budget cap due to a force majeure event, the likely outcome can be synthesized from the following relevant information:

* A force majeure event is defined as any circumstance beyond the reasonable control of an F1 Team affecting its compliance with these Financial Regulations (Section D: Financial Regulations (F1 Teams), F4.2.5).
* The FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, permitting additional occupancy to be used to compensate for that which is lost as a result of a force majeure event (Section D: Financial Regulations (F1 Teams), F4.2.5).
* However, this does not necessarily mean the team will not incur costs above the cap or that they are exempt from penalties.
* The regulations state that in the event of an overspend due to "Force Majeure Events", the Cost Cap Administration may at any time during proceedings propose sanctions for such breach (Section D: Financial Regulations (F1 Teams), D8.10.1).
* Additionally, if a team charged with a Minor Overspend Breach or a Material Overspend Breach is found to have complied with the Cost Cap due to a force majeure event, an express statement to that effect should be included in their sanction report (Section D: Financial Regulations (F1 Teams), D8.11.4).

Given this context, it appears that exceeding the budget cap due to a force majeure event may result in some form of leniency or compensation, but it does not provide blanket immunity from penalties. The likely outcome would depend on how the Cost Cap Administration and FIA choose to apply these regulations in each specific case.

Missing information: None
